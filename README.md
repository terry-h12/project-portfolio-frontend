# Project Portfolio Manager
This project is a web app designed to provide users the ability to upload any projects they are currently working on or have completed. Users have the option to make a project post private if the project is incomplete and can change that setting at a later stage. There is also a 'Users' tab which displays all other user profiles and any public projects they have uploaded.
